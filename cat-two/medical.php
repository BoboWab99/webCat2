   <p>Given the ever-increasing medical expenditures that threaten oneâ€™s finances, a health insurance
      policy has become an absolute necessity. Illnesses have grown quite common, and a typical
      hospitalisation incurs significant medical expenses. Moreover, medical inflation is a consistent
      tendency that increases medical expenses year after year.
      A health insurance policy is the best option in this circumstance, when illnesses and injuries
      are getting increasingly common and medical bills are becoming unsustainable.
      The policy covers medical bills if one is hospitalized and provides much-needed financial
      respite from medical emergencies..
      Medical insurance companies have curated medical policies that cover a range of illnesses and
      offer a myriad of benefits for a substantial amount.</p>
